# Data Mining Project - Heart Disease Dataset
This is a data mining project that focuses on analyzing the Heart Disease dataset using three different algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The project aims to explore and predict heart disease based on various attributes present in the dataset.

## Dataset
The Heart Disease dataset used in this project contains several attributes related to patients' health conditions and the presence of heart disease. The attributes include age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The dataset is provided in a structured format, typically in a CSV or Excel file.

## Algorithms
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point and classifying it based on the majority class among its neighbors. In the context of this project, the KNN algorithm will be applied to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on the input attributes.

2. Naive Bayes
is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. It applies Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among the input features. Naive Bayes calculates the probability of a particular class given the input attributes and selects the class with the highest probability. In this project, the Naive Bayes algorithm will be employed to predict heart disease based on the dataset's attributes.

3. Decision Tree
is a widely used algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. In the context of this project, the Decision Tree algorithm will be utilized to analyze and predict heart disease based on the provided dataset.

## Getting Started
To run the project in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, please follow the steps below:
1. Download the project files from the repository and extract them to a folder on your local machine.
2. Launch Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook on your web browser.
3. Upload the project files to your Google Drive or the desired directory accessible by Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.
4. Create a new notebook or open an existing one.
5. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and observe the output.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this data mining project demonstrates the application of KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree algorithms on the Heart Disease dataset. Through the implementation and evaluation of these algorithms, we gain insights into the predictive capabilities and performance of each method in analyzing heart disease patterns. The findings from this project can contribute to further research and decision-making processes in the field of healthcare.
